<p> The primary purpose for this site as a whole would be to inform AIS middle school students on how to log in, how to behave and recommended courses of action. The secondary purpose of the specific site I'm working on with Pholapat is to be a placeholder while a superhero themed one is being created</p>
<p> The audience would be AIS middle schoolers and there would be two main messages, the primary one would be instructions on how to log in, the secondary would be to tell the middle schoolers to watch what they do online</p>
<p>The general idea I see for the site is a technical and official school based website, and essentially boring, but credible. Each page would need the school logo branded on it and a title in bold to denote what that page is about.</p>
<p> To keep the uniform officiality (no that's not actually a word), every subpage would basically be a clone of the others with different text and a different name, while what they share in common would be the signature AIS website details such as the red base of the page, blue top and the school logo branded on top.</p>
