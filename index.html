<h1> Dreamweaver and Fireworks reflection </h1>
<p>After having given both Fireworks and Dreamweaver a go in terms of creating a storyboard, I have my opinions on the two programs.</p>
<p>Fireworks, I believe, is a faster, simpler, and easier way of creating a storyboard which allows for more freedom in terms of editing pictures and format for one page in one go. However, Dreamweaver although more complicated, creates a page that can more easily be edited over and over again for small changes and even for creating different, but similarly formatted webpages. Also, when working with dreamweaver, dreamweaver grants the ability to directly edit the html text while seeing and editing the page at the same time, this is something that fireworks lacks and requires one to use another program to edit the text and save repeatedly to see the changes actually in effect. In addition to this, Dreamweaver also grants the ability to edit multiple similarly formatted pages at once to enact a small change upon all of them, fireworks however, would require the editor to manually change every page. As a conclusion, I would like to say that both programs are good choices to use, just in specific conditions, as fireworks is faster but only for one page, it is more useful for visual prototypes of individual pages, however, for an entire site, Dreamweaver makes everything more convenient in the long run... though, personally I still prefer fireworks for its simplicity.</p>
